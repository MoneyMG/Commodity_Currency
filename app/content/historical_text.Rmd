## **Framework**

### Defining a Commodity-Exposed Currency

A formal definition a commodity currency remains surprisingly elusive to this day ([A. Jeanneret, V. Sokolovski, 2024](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4564504)). There is a lack of a consistent definition/procedure that can be utilized to draw a conclusion. In the research paper titled *Looking Under the Hood of Commodity Currency Predictability* by Dr. Alexandre Jeanneret and Dr. Valeri Sokolovski, an formal definition has been proposed as:

*"[A commodity currency is] a country's currency that demonstrates a statistically and economically meaningful contemporaneous exposure to its commodity export/import prices, after accounting for the influence of the US dollar."*

### Statistical and Economically Meaningful Exposures

To classify which exporters have such exposures, researchers used a market-based approach utilizing a multivariate linear regression, as follows:

$$
\Delta s_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_i \Delta CP_{i,t} + \gamma_i DOL_t + \varepsilon_{i,t}
$$

Where:

-   $\Delta s_{i,t}$ is the **log change in the exchange rate** of currency $i$ (USD per unit of foreign currency).
-   $\Delta CP_{i,t}$ represents the **log change in the country-specific commodity price index**, calculated using **export/import-weighted changes in international commodity prices**.
-   $DOL_t$ is the **dollar factor**, capturing the **average movement of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar**.
-   $\beta_i$ is the **commodity price beta**, which measures how much the exchange rate moves in response to changes in commodity prices.
-   **A statistically significant** $\beta_i$ **indicates a meaningful exposure of the currency to commodity prices**.

To **control for the influence of the U.S. dollar**, the regression includes $DOL_t$ to ensure that movements in commodity prices are not merely reflecting broad USD fluctuations.

The results of this app's independent reproduction of such data for multiple export-heavy currencies are shown in the bubble chart below, with the size of each bubble relating to R\^2, country on the x-axis, and beta on the y-axis.
